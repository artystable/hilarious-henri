## About The Project

![Screen Shot](https://github.com/artystable/hilarious-henri/blob/main/assets/showcase-meme.png?raw=true)

I've been writing a lot of shell scripts lately and creating little shell contraptions for various sysadmin routinary and troubleshooting tasks. Some of these are actually helpful and I've even started using them across multiple operating systems like mac OS, Ubuntu and other Linux distributions. This project should help managing these utility scripts and recipes easier. I'm also glad to share it with others.

## Built With

This repository is dependency-free as it's mostly brief functional utility shell scripts and configuration files.

## Getting Started

You can set this up by cloning this repository to your favorite system directory. If you need a refresher on this, you can review the GitHub documentation for [Cloning a repository using the command line
](https://docs.github.com/en/github/creating-cloning-and-archiving-repositories/cloning-a-repository#cloning-a-repository-using-the-command-line).

### Prerequisites

This assumes you have git installed already in your system. If not, you should probably install it via your operating system's package manager. For Ubuntu, you'd probably the apt package manager and can install git like this:

* apt

```sh
apt-get install -y git
```

### Installation

1. Clone the repository to your local system and browse around the scripts and script recipes like you're in a buffet line. Pick what you like, ignore whatever looks weird.

2. ???

4. PROFIT.

## Usage

I particularly like the `cs` alias. I'd be interested in learning what you find most or least useful. Open an issue if you get stuck using any of these.

## Roadmap

Ideally, this project might evolve into a more standard `.dotfiles` or some other organized user configurations resource. Realistically, this project will likely get archived before 2022 when my system setup needs are likely to have changed. The truth is, only time will tell. See [heat death of the universe](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heat_death_of_the_universe) for more information.
